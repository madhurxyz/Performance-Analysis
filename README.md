#Performance Analysis
Unlike algorithm analysis which deals with time complexity, the goal of performance analysis is to evaluate how long it actually takes to run programs and functions. I wrote this program to conduct performance analysis on the histogram function.

##How it Works
1. The program generates a 100-word histogram
2. The program generates a 10,000-word histogram
3. The program prints times for generating both
4. A time comparison tells us how many orders of magnitude the 100-gram is faster than the 10,000-gram.
